# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

## Overview
Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is a web application developed to visualize various sorting algorithms in action. The application allows users to observe and understand how sorting algorithms like bubble sort, insertion sort, quick sort, and selection sort work by visualizing the sorting process on a bar graph. Key comparisons and operations are highlighted for enhanced understanding.

## Live Deployment
The project is deployed live and accessible at: [Sorting Algorithm Visualizer](https://anand-sorting-vizualizer.vercel.app/)
